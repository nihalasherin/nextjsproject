This project, developed using Next.js, incorporates React-Bootstrap to create a responsive, visually appealing design. Leveraging Next.js's server-side rendering and optimized loading, the application delivers improved performance and a smooth user experience. React-Bootstrap components streamline styling and layout, making it easy to create consistent, mobile-friendly interfaces. Media queries are employed to further enhance responsiveness, adapting the layout seamlessly across different screen sizes. Additionally, we embedded maps using iframes, allowing users to view locations directly within the interface, ensuring integration without needing additional plugins or complex configurations.
